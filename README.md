  ## About the Project
  This project uses React to render sub-reddits and their content from the popular site Reddit. 
  Data is fetched using the [Reddit JSON API](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/JSON).
  The data is then rendered using React. This project was undertaken to improve my knowledge of React,
  particularly function React Components and [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start), as well as to improve my knowledge of CSS.
